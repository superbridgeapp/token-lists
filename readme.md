Please open PRs against the [official Superchain token list](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io).

The official Superchain token list is more broadly supported, so any tokens merged there will be reflected in more frontends than just Superbridge.

### Superbridge token lists

We use this repository for accepting token listings on [superbridge.app](https://superbridge.app).

To get your token listed, simply open a PR adding the relevant file to the `data` folder. Checks will run to ensure this token is a valid and bridgeable token. For reference, please see [the example](https://github.com/superbridgeapp/token-lists/pull/11) of a valid token listing PR.

Please note that for most token listings your PR will need either,

- to be created by a representative of the project
- include have a verifying tweet from the project Twitter account.
